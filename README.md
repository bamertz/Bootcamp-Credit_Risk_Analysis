# Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. The following methods were used:

* Oversampling using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
* Undersampling using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
* Combined approach of over/undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
* Compare two machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to reduce bias.
